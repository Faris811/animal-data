# Animal Diet Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts an animal's diet type (Carnivore, Herbivore, etc.) based on physical traits like height, weight, and speed using a machine learning pipeline.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 200+ animal species with various biological characteristics.

## Key Features
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled numeric ranges and string cleaning using Regex.
* **Modeling:** Compared Random Forest and SVM models.
* **Visualizations:** Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance analysis.

## Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
